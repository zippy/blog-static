A while back I thought I would take on the discipline of posting a short essay on each book I read. I haven't done that, but here is a list of my recent reading, with one or two sentences for each.

_Goatwalking_, Jim Corbett: Astounding analysis of the relationship of people to society and how to go free. Plus much about the sanctuary movement.

_[Seeing Nature](http://chelseagreen.com/1999/items/524)_, Paul Krafel: Hugely powerful; tools for seeing and thinking about the universe in new ways, simply told, but profound. I read twice.

_Passionate Marriage_, David Schnarch: Life changing book. Triggered many understandings for how to actually grow up.

_Agile Web Development with Rails_ & _Programming Ruby_, Dave Thomas: Two very well written coding books to feed my latest programming need.

_Discipline & Punish_, Michel Foucault: Deep insight into why and how society is structured around and needs prisons and criminals.

_When Things Fall Apart_, Pema ChÃ¶drÃ¶n: Essays on Buddhism in the tradition of Trungpa.

_Shambhala; The Sacred Path of the Warrior_, ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa: A Tibetan Buddhist's approach cast for western appeal. Insightful and inspiring, but often it feels like he uses many words and phrases that would have more power if I knew Tibetan culture.

_The Barn at the End of the World_, Mary Rose O'Reilley: A Quaker Buddhists spiritual path which includes much about sheep. Funny and delightful to read.

_The Diamond Cutter_, Micheal Roach: An approach to Buddhist practice aimed at business men. Some powerful methodologies and explanations of Buddhism especially about the concept of karma, though he mentions the word only once. Roach is also a trained Buddhist monk.

_Mind and Nature_, Gregory Bateson: I read this book and then read it again immediately it was so good. It's a deeply synthetic presentation of what mind is and where it comes from, with lots of other goodies thrown in, like fantastic definitions of addiction, explanation, and more.

_Towards and Epistemology of the Sacred_, Gregory Bateson and Mary Catherine Bateson: posthumous completion of Bateson's last work by his brilliant daughter.

_The Laws of Form_, G. Spencer Brown: Almost impossible to understand presentation of a fundamental mathematics starting from the fundament of making a distinction. I will be reading this one again too.

_Only Two Can Play This Game_, James Keyes (G. Spencer Brown): Supposedly exactly the same as The Laws of Form but in prose. Some dated phrasings making it odd to read, but fun to read. Basically it's a love story and the initial distinction is maleness and femaleness.
