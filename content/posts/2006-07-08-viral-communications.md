I've just read Andrew Lippman and [David Reed](http://www.satn.org/satn_rss.xml)'s [paper on Viral Communications](http://dl.media.mit.edu/viral/viral.pdf). It's quite insightful. Two things:

1. I've said it before, but "Intelligence at the Leaves" for currency is what the [open money](http://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/openmoney.org) project is all about. Currency is **the** centralized communication tool that needs to undergo the same process that Lippman and Reed describe in the paper, for all the same reasons. "In the end, viral communications transforms communication from something you buy to something you do. Independence of operation allows communications services to be separated from traditional service providers." Substitute currency for communication.
2. On a more speculative note: maybe the reason why SETI has not been successful so far, is that intelligent species move very quickly to low power [Tim Shepard](http://www.lcs.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-670.pdf) style scalable radio! So our current high power RF output is very naturally a short lived (i.e. 200 year) stage in technological development, that lasts only long enough for us to realize that we are better served with a very different pattern of radio usage, which is not detectable at interstellar distances. Assuming this is true, I'd gues that the probablity of catching another intelligence in the same 200 year window is not very high.
