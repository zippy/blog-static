I was looking at how perl6 is coming along and found this: http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-5-to-6/ which is really cool.  Besides being a really nice presentation of the material (including the "Motivation" section) there's just lotsa nice stuff.  Some of the new way outa here cool perl6 features:

- meta operators
- gather/take construct for lazy lists
- grammars
- Enums
- twigils
- custom operators

And that's just a few...
