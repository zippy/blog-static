Michael & Eric are walking down the road talking about what people will do for money. Michael sees a steaming pile of dog poop and says: "Eric, I'll give you 20 grand if you eat some of that." Eric thinks, wow good deal, and does. Michael says "ok, I owe you 20k." A little while further down, there's another dog pile, and Eric says to Michael, "I'll give you 20,000 big smacker if you eat some of that." And Michael thinks, that's an easy way to cancel my debt, so he does. They walk for a few more minutes and Eric says: "whoa, we both just ate dog shit and none of us is a penny richer!" Michael says, "yeah, but the Gross National Product just went up by 40K!" \[tags\]joke,money,GNP\[/tags\]
