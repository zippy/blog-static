The open source movement is, I think, the tip of the iceberg of a fundamental sea change in human thought that is swirling all around us. I had been emailing with a friend about how Quakerism seemed to me to embody in a religion,the principles of open source software because (I wrote) "it handles the balance of the community and the individual in a precise way: 1) the individual is highly autonomous and assumed to have unique and direct access to the devine. I.e. everybody can write code. 2) because this is true of everyone, individual revelation must be checked with the group for further descernment, i.e. your code has to be checked in to the repository and actually work with the whole system! Thus there is no preacher/parishoner or consumer/producer relationship, we all minister to eachother (we are all prosumers)." My friend pointed me to various links on [open source spirituality](http://www.communitywiki.org/odd/EvolutionaryNexus/LinksBin) that are worth looking at. I was especially intruiged by [yoism](http://www.yoism.org/) which at first seems like yet-another-newagey spirituality thingy, but on closer inspection is quite a bit more than that. \[tags\]spirit,FLOSS,yoism\[/tags\]
