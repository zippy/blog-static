If you've been involved in the creative commons, open source, free software, or any of the many strands of thinking that are developing along these lines, then [Copyright, Copy-Left, and the Creative Anti-Commons](http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors0/nimustext.html) by Anna Nimus is a must read. She provides a very provocative understanding of the fundamental idea of copy-right, from it's historical genesis, to how it relates to the Lawrence Lessig's Creative Commons work. The paper is long, but it's very well worth the read.
