The meme of coming multi-currency world is beginning to be visible to the main stream. To see how, watch this [Wall Street Journal tech video](http://online.wsj.com/video/the-coming-currency-revolution/25225F5A-B979-4609-A55D-1BAE9A1BA158.html) by Andy Jordan. Not only is yours truly and the [MetaCurrency project](http://metacurrency.org) shown (I'm not really an economist BTW), but also some other nice efforts that show the growth in understanding of what currency can be.
