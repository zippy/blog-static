So marketing blogger Seth Godin has a [mention](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/03/wish_i_had_it.html) of [SnapMail](http://glassbead.com/snapmail) in the same breath as File Maker Pro on his blog. It's nice that my humble little program is in such august company, though the context is a bit sad. What's so odd is how SnapMail was created before the Internet was at all a house-hold word, back in 93, and it still has such a faithful following. I guess there is something valuable about having a little communication tool that's **_not_** on the Internet! Who'da a thunk?
