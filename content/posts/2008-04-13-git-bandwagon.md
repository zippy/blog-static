Well, I've officially joined the git bandwagon. Â I've putÂ [metaform up on github](http://github.com/zippy/metaform/tree/master)Â (theÂ [open money](http://openmoney.info)Â projects will come soon, but I think probably onÂ [gitorious](http://gitorious.org)); I've been reading tons ofÂ [articles about gi](http://del.icio.us/zippy/git)t; I installed it on Tiger (use MacPorts) and Leopard (install from source withÂ [these instructions](http://subtlegradient.com/articles/2008/02/21/install_git_leopard)Â but use 1.5.5); and now I'm blogging about it. Â TheÂ [most interesting article](http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/)Â so far on git, has made me realize how closely related it is to theÂ [mesh and churn](http://openmoney.info/techne/overview.html)... Â Quite interesting!
