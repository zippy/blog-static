There’s a Zulu saying "Amathanga ahlanzela abangenamabhodo," which means “Pumpkins also multiply for those without pots.” It means that abundance is the natural state of all human beings, but we have to have belief that it can happen and do everything we can all the time to make it happen. You can achieve the impossible, but to do it, you need to see the invisible. We know how many seeds there are in a pumpkin, but we don't know how many pumpkins there are in a seed.
