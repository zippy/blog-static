Seems like end of the year is DYI electronics projects time for me as the Sound Alarm happened round this time last year too.  Well, I've been having a ball making Arduino stuff, this time as Christmas presents.  This time I got my documentation act together even more and made [a construction tutorial on instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Das-Blinken-Bonken-An-arduino-ball-throwing-game-p/) too!   The code for Das Blinken Bonken is on [github](https://github.com/zippy/blinken-bonken), and here's a video of Jesse showing off the game:
