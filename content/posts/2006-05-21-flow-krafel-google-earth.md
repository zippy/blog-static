This week I was given a copy of [Paul Krafel's](http://www.krafel.net/) mini-film [The Upward Sprial](http://www.chrysalischarterschool.com/Paul/Paul/HOPE.html). Which, despite, nay in part because of, some hoakyness, provides deep and powerful language and images for how to look at the world. He talks about flow, feedback spirals, and a "second solution" to the problem posed by the second law of thermodynamics. It is both philosphical and practical for those looking to change our broken world.

Just for fun I took this an opportunity to learn [kml](http://earth.google.com/kml/) so that we could map the flow of the spread of Krafel's ideas using google earth. If you want to play, go to a little site I created where you can [add your location](http://harris-braun.com/us.html) and then add to a network link into your google earth and see the location of all of those who have entered their locations to the map.

Enjoy!

<div class="comment-content prose dark:prose-invert"><p>I just got the DVD, too, and agree that the hoakiness of the production added to the believability/buy-in on my part. If it were any more slickly produced, it likely wouldn&#x27;t have captured my imagination as much as it did.</p><p>My favorite quote from the DVD was &quot;You can count the seeds in an apple, but you can&#x27;t count the apples in the seed.&quot;</p><p>Watched it while flying in for the Identity Mashup conference. I&#x27;ll be adding my location in Google Earth later when I figure out what part of the country I covered in the hour it took to watch en route to BOS from SFO.</p></div>
