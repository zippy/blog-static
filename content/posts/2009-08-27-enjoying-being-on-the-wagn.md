We are building out the [new currency frontiers](http://newcurrencyfrontiers.com) web-site, using the [Wagn](http://www.wagn.org/), which is pretty darn cool. It's a wiki + database + cms. It's kinda geeky, but not so much that you have to be a programer to use it (so don't freak if your aren't), but if you are a programming inclined, there's lots of nice stuff you can. Ethan and Lewis are are the excellent chaps wheeling the Wagn. Kudos dudes.
