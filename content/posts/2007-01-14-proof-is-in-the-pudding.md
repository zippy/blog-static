The power behind the open source/creative commons movement lies in the value of letting go of ownership of your productive work and trusting that the value you could have charged for directly by not doing so, will instead be returned to you indirectly.

So, I did this for my paper on the [process revolutuion](http://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/2006/07/11/id-30) and I have thereby experience this fact directly. Zack Clarck has ["forked" my paper](http://yenom.biz/?page_id=41), changing various terms I used to describe concepts, changing the flavor of the paper by making it less neutral and more strongly worded, and adding new ideas as well. The power of this occurrence is tremendous. The old model would have been to find a journal to publish the idea in, and collect money on the sale, and sue for copyright infringement because of lost sales, blah, blah, blah.

It all points to the difference between money and wealth.
