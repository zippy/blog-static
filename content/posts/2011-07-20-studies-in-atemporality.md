Just browsing [Bruce Sterling's studies in atemporality flicker stream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brucesterling/sets/72157619722832388/with/5888956556/). It makes me think of [Calvin Luther Martin's "In the Spirit of the Earth: Rethinking History and Time"](http://www.amazon.com/Spirit-Earth-Rethinking-History-Time/dp/0801847095) in which he claims that paleolithic peoples well understood the technologies of agriculture and building ascribed to the move to the neolithic, but didn't use them because of their world-view. I think we too are well ready to step back out of time, and lose our enslavement to a historical outlook. Sterling's images are teasers for us.
