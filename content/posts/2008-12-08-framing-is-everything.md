Ellen got these two summaries of news items from the ny-times:

[Detroit Bailout Is to Bring On U.S. Oversight](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/08/washington/08autos.html?th&emc=th) By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and JACKIE CALMES Congressional Democrats were drafting legislation for government control of the auto industry, including the possible creation of an oversight board.

[In Hard Times, Russia Moves In to Reclaim Private Industries](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/08/world/europe/08kremlin.html?_r=1&th&emc=th) By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

The Kremlin seems to be exploiting the economic crisis to establish more control over financially weakened industries that it has long coveted.

Pretty funny no?
