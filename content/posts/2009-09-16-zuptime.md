So today a bunch of our websites went down, and the scripts I had in place to monitor for this type of occasion hadn't been updated for some time so the new websites weren't even in the scripts. Upshot: I didn't notice for too long.

Then I went looking for web-site status monitoring tools, and well, as usual, I didn't find anything I liked, so it's once again it was roll-your-own time! So I created a little [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) based web app to make it easy to add in new sites and see their current status, if they go down have a per-site list of e-mail addresses be notified, etc.

The resulting goodness is called zuptime and is open sourced and [available for all to play with!](http://github.com/zippy/zuptime)
